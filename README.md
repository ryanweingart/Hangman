## Overview

Welcome to Italian Destination Word Guess! Your objective is to guess the famous Italian region, city or town by choosing different letters.

## Directions

* At the start of the game, blank spaces will appear on the left side of the screen that represent the amount of letters in the hidden word.
* The player will try and guess the word by typing a letter that they think is in the word.
* If the letter that the player guesses is in the word, it will replace the blank space where it is located in the hidden word.
* If the letter is not in the word, it will be placed in the "Incorrect Leters" list and one life will be taken away.
* The player has 9 guesses to win the round!
  * If the player guesses the word correctly, an image of the famous Italian region, city or town that was guessed will appear, the wins will increase and  a new hidden word will appear.
  * If the player losses all 9 guesses before getting the correct word, a new hidden word will appear and the wins will not increase.
  
### Good luck!
